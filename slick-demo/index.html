            <h2>Ocean Fact 1</h2>
            <p>Oceans have an average depth of 12,100 feet, and because light waves can only penetrate 330 feet of water, everything below that point is dark. Seeing as water makes up most of the planet, this means that most of Earth exists in absolute darkness all the time..</p>

            <h2>Ocean Fact 2</h2>
            <p>At its widest point, from Indonesia all the way to Colombia, the Pacific Ocean is wider than the moon, by quite a lot. This expanse of ocean is 12,300 miles across, which is more than five times the diameter of the moon!</p>

            <h2>Ocean Fact 3</h2>
            <p>The biggest ocean waves are not the ones that you can see from the shoreline. As physical oceanographer Kim Martini told Deep Sea News, the largest waves that occur in the ocean are called internal waves, which take place between two fluids with two different densities. As these internal waves travel—for thousands of miles, no less—they can grow to be 650 feet tall.</p>

            <h2>Ocean Fact 4</h2>
            <p>Because precious little of the oceans has been explored, it is currently estimated that 91% of the species that exist under the sea have yet to be discovered, according to a 2011 study published in PLoS Biology.</p>
